1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.

2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

 **Project Overview**

 **This project involves**

-Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

-ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

-Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

-Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
   
🎯 This Project showcases Data skills in the following Tech fields:

    SQL Development

    Data Architect

🚀 **Project Requirements**

Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.


**Specifications**

Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.


**BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)***

**Objective**

Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

Customer Behavior
Product Performance
Sales Trends
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
